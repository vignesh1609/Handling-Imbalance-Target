# Handling-Imbalance-Target
A widely adopted technique for dealing with highly unbalanced datasets is called resampling.

# Undersampling: 
It is the process where you randomly delete some of the observations from the majority class in order to match the numbers with the minority class.

# Oversampling:
It is the process of generating synthetic data that tries to randomly generate a sample of the attributes from observations in the minority class.


Please check attached notebook to implement these techniques.
